## 🚧 Work in Progress

I’m currently working on developing Power BI dashboards using datasets from different business domains such as:

- 🏪 **Bike Shop Sales Dashboard** — analyzing sales, customers, and product performance  
- 🏦 **Banking Insights Dashboard** — tracking customer activity and financial KPIs  
- 📈 **General Business Analytics** — exploring trends, forecasting, and data visualization  

Once complete, each project will include:
- `.pbix` Power BI file  
- Description of the project goals and data used  
- Example screenshots or exported visuals  
- Key takeaways and insights
